# How to contribute

*Terima Kasih*\* for wanting to help contribute to this project!

The team currently owning & maintaining this project is very small, so just drop a mail at `sg.parliament.debates.analyst@gmail(dot)com` and we can sync up further offline. Please feel free to reach out, and do not work as a lone wolf since the context may not be clear from existing docs.

## Testing

We have no automated tests at the moment, but PRs for extracting heavy business logic away into their separate utils and adding unit tests for them are welcome :)

## Deploying

There is no CI/CD set up for this package yet. Deployments will be made once a PR is merged and tested.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to opengovernment](https://github.com/whatsayyourmp/whatsayyourmp.github.io/pull/new/main) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

The commit summaries are enforced by Commitlint with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) as spec.

## Coding conventions

* Style is enforced by `eslint` as far as possible
* If not familiar, please read up on [Clean Code](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript)

## Misc.
